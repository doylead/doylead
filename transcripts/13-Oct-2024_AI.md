# Transcript with Gemini Advanced, 10/13/2024

All prompts and responses were held in a single "window" of conversation with Gemini Advanced accessed 10/13/2024.

Not all dialogue is shown, as this document is already long.  However the entire conversation is shown or summarized.  Only parts of the conversation  that seemed less likely to be interesting (e.g. my failing to uninstall NextJS to correct a version dependency issue) have been summarized rather than shown.

Generally speaking I will observe the following conventions:
* I label each prompt and response set a "turn" to make referencing specific parts of the conversation easier
* Any human language prompt I provide to Gemini will appear at the beginning of a "turn" in block quotes
> like this.
* The one time I provide Gemini code input I will write "Gemini's rsesponse" to separate the two

## Turn 1

> I want to build a blog with NextJS serving as the front end.  What options do I have?

That's a great choice! Next.js is a powerful and flexible framework that's well-suited for building blogs. Here's a breakdown of your options, from simple to more advanced:

**1. Markdown Files and `getStaticProps`:**

*   How it works: You write your blog posts in Markdown files, and Next.js uses its `getStaticProps` function to pre-render these into HTML pages at build time. This is excellent for SEO and performance.
*   Pros: Simple, fast, and great for static content.
*   Cons: Requires a rebuild to update content. Not ideal for frequent updates or dynamic features like comments.
*   Example: Next.js's own tutorial uses this approach: [Creating a Blog Example](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/data-fetching/blog-data)

**2. Headless CMS:**

*   How it works: You use a separate content management system (CMS) like Contentful, Sanity, or Prismic to manage your blog content. Next.js fetches this content via APIs.
*   Pros: Excellent for content editing, collaboration, and managing large amounts of content. Provides flexibility and scalability.
*   Cons: Can be more complex to set up initially. May require a paid CMS subscription.
*   Example: [Build a Next.js Blog with Prismic](https://prismic.io/blog/nextjs-blog-tutorial)

**3. Database and API Routes:**

*   How it works: You store your blog data in a database (e.g., Supabase, MongoDB, PostgreSQL) and create API routes in Next.js to interact with the database (create, read, update, delete content).
*   Pros: Full control over your data and content structure. Can easily add dynamic features like comments, user authentication, and more.
*   Cons: Requires more backend development and database management.

**4. Full-stack Frameworks with Next.js:**

*   How it works: Combine Next.js with a full-stack framework like RedwoodJS or Blitz.js, which provide built-in features for databases, authentication, and more.
*   Pros: Streamlined development experience with conventions and tools for building complex applications.
*   Cons: Can add more overhead compared to a simpler approach. Might be overkill for a basic blog.

**Choosing the right option depends on your needs:**

*   Simple blog with infrequent updates: Markdown files.
*   Frequent updates and collaboration: Headless CMS.
*   Dynamic features and full control: Database and API routes.
*   Rapid development with full-stack features: Full-stack framework.

I'm ready to help you with any of these approaches! Just let me know what you'd like to explore further. Do you have any preferences or specific features in mind for your blog?


## Turn 2
> I'm most interested in the first two options.  I tried setting up NextJS to read markdown files, but I'm worried the tutorials I found may be outdated.  Can you show a minimal example using the app router, typescript, and tailwind CSS?

You're right to be cautious about outdated tutorials! Next.js 13 introduced the app directory with some changes to how things work. Here's a minimal example of a blog using the app directory, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, along with explanations:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-blog --ts
cd my-blog
npm install gray-matter
```

**1. Project Setup:**

*   We use `create-next-app` with the `--ts` flag to create a TypeScript project.
*   Install `gray-matter` to parse Markdown files with frontmatter (metadata).

**2.  `app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx`:**

```typescript
import { MetadataRoute } from 'next/server'
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation'
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises'
import path from 'path'
import matter from 'gray-matter'

export async function generateMetadata({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }): MetadataRoute {
  const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts')
  try {
    const filePath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${params.slug}.md`)
    const fileContents = await readFile(filePath, 'utf8')
    const { data } = matter(fileContents)
    return {
      title: data.title
    }
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      title: 'Post Not Found'
    }
  }
}

export default async function PostPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts')
  try {
    const filePath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${params.slug}.md`)
    const fileContents = await readFile(filePath, 'utf8')

    const { data, content } = matter(fileContents)

    return (
      <main className="px-8 py-16">
        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">{data.title}</h1>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">{data.date}</p>
        <article dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: content }} /> {/* Render Markdown */}
      </main>
    )
  } catch (error) {
    notFound()
  }
}
```

*   This file defines a dynamic route (`[slug]`) to handle individual blog posts.
*   `generateMetadata`: Extracts the title from the Markdown frontmatter for the page's metadata.
*   `PostPage`: Reads the Markdown file, parses it using `gray-matter`, and renders the title, date, and content.

**3. Create Markdown Files:**

*   Create a `posts` directory at the root of your project.
*   Add Markdown files like `my-first-post.md`:

```markdown
---
title: My First Blog Post
date: 2024-10-13
---

This is the content of my blog post.
```

**4.  `app/layout.tsx`:**

```typescript
import type { Metadata } from 'next'

import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'
import './globals.css'

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'My Blog',
  description: 'Generated by create next app',
}

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

*   Sets up the basic layout for your blog. You'll likely want to add navigation and other elements here.

**5.  `app/page.tsx`:**

```typescript
import Link from 'next/link'
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises'
import path from 'path'
import matter from 'gray-matter'

export default async function Home() {
  const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts')
  const filenames = await readFile(postsDirectory, 'utf8')

  const posts = await Promise.all(
    filenames.map(async (filename) => {
      const filePath = path.join(postsDirectory, filename)
      const fileContents = await readFile(filePath, 'utf8')
      const { data } = matter(fileContents)
      return {
        slug: filename.replace(/\.md$/, ''),
        title: data.title,
        date: data.date,
      }
    })
  )

  return (
    <main className="px-8 py-16">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-8">My Blog</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.slug} className="mb-4">
            <Link href={`/posts/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>
            <span className="text-gray-600 ml-2">{post.date}</span>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </main>
  )
}
```

*   This is the homepage of your blog. It reads all Markdown files from the `posts` directory and displays links to them.

**6. Tailwind CSS:**

*   If you haven't already, follow the Tailwind CSS installation instructions for Next.js: [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).
*   This will allow you to use Tailwind's utility classes in your components.

This example provides a basic blog structure. You can expand it by:

*   Adding more styling with Tailwind.
*   Implementing a layout component with navigation.
*   Creating a separate page for each post.
*   Adding dynamic features like comments.

Feel free to ask if you have any questions or want to explore any of these features!

## Turns 3-9
I was having issues installing `gray-matter` because I was using React 19 as part of Next 15.  `npm` did not want to let me install or uninstall just about anything, which may very well be the result of some mistake I made.  After this much time spent troubleshooting I just opted to create a new project using Next 14.

As a brief summary, Gemini did correctly determine the version conflict (and where the reference to React 19 came from).  However, I was unable to use the steps provided by Gemini to uninstall NextJS.

## Turn 10
> I'm now getting the following error when attempting to navigate to localhost:3000/  
Error: EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, read

This "EISDIR" error usually means that Node.js is trying to read a file, but it's encountering a directory instead. This can happen for a few reasons in a Next.js project:

**Possible Causes and Solutions**

1. **Incorrect File Path:**

   * **Check your code:** Review your `app/page.tsx` and `app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx` files (or any custom server components). Ensure that the file paths you're using to read Markdown files are correct and actually point to `.md` files, not directories.
   * **`path.join()`:** Double-check that you're using `path.join()` correctly to construct file paths, especially if you're dealing with dynamic routes.

2. **Incorrect `readFile` Usage:**

   * **`readFile` is for files:** The `fs.readFile()` method is designed to read files, not directories. If you're accidentally passing a directory path to `readFile`, you'll get this error.
   * **`readdir` for directories:** If you need to read the contents of a directory (e.g., to get a list of Markdown files), use `fs.readdir()` instead.

3. **Caching Issues:**

   * **Clear the Next.js cache:** Sometimes, old cached files can cause problems. Try deleting your `.next` directory and rebuilding your project:

     ```bash
     rm -rf .next
     npm run build
     ```

4. **File System Permissions:**

   * **Check permissions:** Make sure your Next.js process has the necessary read permissions for the directories and files it's trying to access.

**Debugging Steps**

1. **Pinpoint the Error:** Examine the error message and stack trace closely. It should give you an indication of which file and line number the error is occurring on.
2. **Console Logging:** Add `console.log()` statements to your code to print the file paths you're constructing and the results of any file system operations. This will help you track down where the incorrect directory path is being used.
3. **Simplify:** If you have a complex setup, try creating a minimal example with just one or two Markdown files to see if you can reproduce the error. This can help you isolate the issue.

**Example: Correct `readFile` Usage**

```typescript
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';
import path from 'path';

async function readMarkdownFile(slug: string) {
  const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts');
  const filePath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${slug}.md`); 

  try {
    const fileContents = await readFile(filePath, 'utf8');
    // Process the fileContents (e.g., with gray-matter)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error reading Markdown file:', error);
  }
}
```

If you can provide the following, I might be able to give you more specific guidance:

*   The relevant code snippets from your `app/page.tsx` and `app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx` files.
*   The full error message and stack trace.
*   The structure of your `posts` directory.

## Turn 11
> in the code you provided earlier I see the line:  
`const filenames = await readFile(postsDirectory, 'utf8')`  
>Is this appropriate?  It seems we're trying to use readFile on a directory

You're absolutely correct! That line was a mistake in the code I provided earlier. 

`readFile` is meant for reading files, not directories. To get the list of filenames within the `posts` directory, you should use `fs.readdir()` instead.

Here's the corrected `app/page.tsx` code:

```typescript
import Link from 'next/link';
import { readdir, readFile } from 'fs/promises';
import path from 'path';
import matter from 'gray-matter';

export default async function Home() {
  const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts');
  const filenames = await readdir(postsDirectory); // Use readdir here

  const posts = await Promise.all(
    filenames.map(async (filename) => {
      const filePath = path.join(postsDirectory, filename);
      const fileContents = await readFile(filePath, 'utf8');
      const { data } = matter(fileContents);
      return {
        slug: filename.replace(/\.md$/, ''),
        title: data.title,
        date: data.date,
      };
    })
  );

  return (
    <main className="px-8 py-16">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-8">My Blog</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.slug} className="mb-4">
            <Link href={`/posts/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>
            <span className="text-gray-600 ml-2">{post.date}</span>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </main>
  );
}
```

I apologize for the error in my previous response. I'm still under development and learning to be more accurate. Thanks for catching that!

With this correction, the `EISDIR` error should be resolved. If you have any more questions or run into further issues, feel free to ask!

## Turn 12:
> now I see the following when attempting to load that page:  
Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: [object Date]). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.

Ah, you're right! That's another oversight in the code I provided. Apologies for that. 

The issue is with this part in your `app/page.tsx`:

```typescript
<span className="text-gray-600 ml-2">{post.date}</span> 
```

You're trying to render `post.date` directly, which is a JavaScript `Date` object. React doesn't know how to render a `Date` object as a child.

**Solution:**

You need to convert the `Date` object to a string before rendering it. Here's how you can do that:

```typescript
<span className="text-gray-600 ml-2">{post.date.toDateString()}</span>
```

This will use the `toDateString()` method to convert the `Date` object to a human-readable string format.

**Here's the updated `app/page.tsx` with the fix:**

```typescript
import Link from 'next/link';
import { readdir, readFile } from 'fs/promises';
import path from 'path';
import matter from 'gray-matter';

export default async function Home() {
  // ... (rest of your code) ...

  return (
    <main className="px-8 py-16">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-8">My Blog</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.slug} className="mb-4">
            <Link href={`/posts/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>
            <span className="text-gray-600 ml-2">{post.date.toDateString()}</span> {/* Fix here */}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </main>
  );
}
```

I'm getting better, but I still make mistakes sometimes. Thank you for your patience as I learn and improve! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## Turn 13:
> after making that change in both `app/page.tsx` and `app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx` I do see the blog page load.  But the markdown isn't rendering

You're encountering this issue because you're using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render the Markdown content. This method expects a string of HTML, but the `content` you get from `gray-matter` is still plain Markdown.

To render Markdown correctly in your Next.js app directory, you have a few options:

**1.  `remark` and `rehype` (Recommended)**

   * This is the most common and flexible approach for processing Markdown in Next.js.
   * You'll need to install the necessary packages:

     ```bash
     npm install remark rehype remark-html rehype-raw
     ```

   * Then, update your `app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx` file:

     ```typescript
     import { MetadataRoute } from 'next/server';
     import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';
     import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';
     import path from 'path';
     import matter from 'gray-matter';
     import { remark } from 'remark';
     import html from 'remark-html';
     import rehypeRaw from 'rehype-raw'; // Allows embedding HTML in Markdown

     // ... (generateMetadata function) ...

     export default async function PostPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
       const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts');
       try {
         const filePath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${params.slug}.md`);
         const fileContents = await readFile(filePath, 'utf8');

         const { data, content } = matter(fileContents);

         // Use remark to convert Markdown to HTML
         const processedContent = await remark()
           .use(rehypeRaw) // Add this to support HTML in Markdown
           .use(html)
           .process(content);
         const contentHtml = processedContent.toString();

         return (
           <main className="px-8 py-16">
             <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">{data.title}</h1>
             <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">{data.date.toDateString()}</p>
             <article dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: contentHtml }} /> 
           </main>
         );
       } catch (error) {
         notFound();
       }
     }
     ```

**2. React Markdown Libraries**

   * There are several React libraries specifically designed for rendering Markdown, such as `react-markdown`:

     ```bash
     npm install react-markdown
     ```

   *  Update your `app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx`:

     ```typescript
     import { MetadataRoute } from 'next/server';
     import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';
     import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';
     import path from 'path';
     import matter from 'gray-matter';
     import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown';

     // ... (generateMetadata function) ...

     export default async function PostPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
       // ... (rest of your code) ...

       return (
         <main className="px-8 py-16">
           <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">{data.title}</h1>
           <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">{data.date.toDateString()}</p>
           <article>
             <ReactMarkdown>{content}</ReactMarkdown> 
           </article>
         </main>
       );
       // ...
     }
     ```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Security:** When using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, be very careful about the source of your Markdown content. If you're allowing users to input Markdown, you'll need to sanitize it to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
* **Performance:** For large amounts of Markdown content, consider using a more performant library or a dedicated Markdown parser.
* **Features:** If you need advanced Markdown features (e.g., syntax highlighting, tables, etc.), you might need to use plugins or a different library.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or run into any issues while implementing these changes.

## Turn 14

> provide a list of pros and cons for each approach

You're right to consider the pros and cons of each approach! Here's a breakdown to help you decide which Markdown rendering method is best for your Next.js blog:

**1. `remark` and `rehype`**

**Pros:**

* **Flexibility:**  Remark and Rehype provide a highly flexible and powerful system for processing Markdown. You can customize the parsing and rendering process with a wide range of plugins to add features like syntax highlighting, custom elements, and more.
* **Performance:** Remark is generally considered very performant, especially when combined with Rehype for efficient HTML generation.
* **Standards-compliant:**  Remark and Rehype adhere to Markdown standards, ensuring your content is rendered correctly across different platforms.
* **Ecosystem:**  A large and active community supports Remark and Rehype, with many plugins and resources available.

**Cons:**

* **Learning curve:**  It might take some time to learn the Remark and Rehype APIs and how to use plugins effectively.
* **Setup:**  Setting up Remark and Rehype requires installing multiple packages and configuring them in your Next.js project.

**2. React Markdown Libraries (e.g., `react-markdown`)**

**Pros:**

* **Ease of use:** React Markdown libraries are typically very easy to use. You simply import the component and pass your Markdown content as a prop.
* **Integration:** These libraries are designed specifically for React, making them integrate seamlessly into your Next.js components.
* **Simplicity:**  They often have a smaller footprint and fewer dependencies compared to Remark and Rehype.

**Cons:**

* **Limited flexibility:** React Markdown libraries might offer less flexibility for customizing the Markdown parsing and rendering process compared to Remark and Rehype.
* **Performance:**  While generally performant for smaller amounts of content, some React Markdown libraries might not be as optimized as Remark for handling large Markdown files.
* **Potential security risks:**  If the library doesn't handle sanitization properly, there could be security risks when rendering user-generated Markdown content.


**Which one to choose?**

* **For simple blogs with basic Markdown:** A React Markdown library like `react-markdown` might be sufficient and easier to set up.
* **For more complex blogs with advanced features (e.g., code syntax highlighting, custom elements, or a need for high performance):** Remark and Rehype offer greater flexibility and control.

Ultimately, the best approach depends on your specific needs and preferences. If you're unsure, I recommend starting with a React Markdown library and considering switching to Remark and Rehype if you need more advanced features or better performance later on.

> There seems to have been some issue with printing the code for `app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx` when using react-markdown.  Please repeat it

You're absolutely right! It seems I had some issues with formatting and providing the complete code in my previous response. 

Here's the corrected and complete code for `app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx` when using `react-markdown`:

```typescript
import { MetadataRoute } from 'next/server';
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';
import path from 'path';
import matter from 'gray-matter';
import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown'; // Import react-markdown

export async function generateMetadata({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }): MetadataRoute {
  const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts');
  try {
    const filePath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${params.slug}.md`);
    const fileContents = await readFile(filePath, 'utf8');
    const { data } = matter(fileContents);
    return {
      title: data.title
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      title: 'Post Not Found'
    };
  }
}

export default async function PostPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts');
  try {
    const filePath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${params.slug}.md`);
    const fileContents = await readFile(filePath, 'utf8');

    const { data, content } = matter(fileContents);

    return (
      <main className="px-8 py-16">
        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">{data.title}</h1>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">{data.date.toDateString()}</p>
        <article>
          <ReactMarkdown>{content}</ReactMarkdown> {/* Use ReactMarkdown component */}
        </article>
      </main>
    );
  } catch (error) {
    notFound();
  }
}
```

**Key points**

*   Make sure you have `react-markdown` installed: `npm install react-markdown`
*   Import `ReactMarkdown` from `react-markdown`.
*   Use the `<ReactMarkdown>` component to render the `content` within your `article`.

I apologize for the errors and omissions in my previous responses. I am constantly learning and improving, and I appreciate your patience as I work to provide more accurate and helpful information.

      .process(content);
    const contentHtml = processedContent.toString();

    return (
      <main className="px-8 py-16">
        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">{data.title}</h1>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">{data.date.toDateString()}</p>
        <article dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: contentHtml }} />

    );
  } catch (error) {
    notFound();
  }
}
```

**Explanation**

1.  Import necessary modules:
    *   `remark`: The core Markdown processor.
    *   `html`:  A Remark plugin to convert Markdown to HTML.
    *   `rehypeRaw`: A Rehype plugin to allow raw HTML inside your Markdown. This is important if your Markdown files might contain HTML elements.

2.  Process Markdown:
    *   Create a Remark processor using `remark()`.
    *   Use the `rehypeRaw` plugin to support HTML in Markdown.
    *   Use the `html` plugin to convert Markdown to HTML.
    *   Process the Markdown `content` using `.process(content)`.
    *   Convert the processed content to a string using `.toString()`.

3.  Render the HTML:
    *   Use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render the `contentHtml` string.

**Important:** Remember to install the required packages:

```bash
npm install remark rehype remark-html rehype-raw
```

## Turn 17-41

Simply put, I was getting 404 errors.  Commenting out the line `.use(rehypeRaw)` showed (appropriately rendered) pages based on markdown files.

At this time, I do still do not understand the issues with the `rehypeRaw` in the code provided above or in my environment setup.  I tried with incredibly minimal markdown pages and got errors like ``Error getting post data: Error: Cannot compile `paragraph` node...`` and the I could not get around this despite several hours of honest effort.

## Turn 42

After the issues above, I found another example and tried to prompt Gemini:
> can you modify your example for app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx to use syntax like the following? (This code block provided as input) 
```typescript import { unified } from "unified";  
import remarkParse from "remark-parse";  
import remarkRehype from "remark-rehype";  
import rehypeStringify from "rehype-stringify";  
const processor = unified()  
  .use(remarkParse)  
  .use(remarkRehype)  
  .use(rehypeStringify)
  ```
Gemini's response:

```typescript
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';
import path from 'path';
import matter from 'gray-matter';
import { unified } from 'unified';
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse';
import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype';
import rehypeRaw from 'rehype-raw';
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify';

async function getPostData(slug: string) {
  const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts');
  const filePath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${slug}.md`);

  try {
    const fileContents = await readFile(filePath, 'utf8');
    const { data, content } = matter(fileContents);

    // Use unified to process Markdown
    const processedContent = await unified()
      .use(remarkParse)
      .use(remarkRehype, { allowDangerousHtml: true }) // Allow raw HTML
      .use(rehypeRaw) 
      .use(rehypeStringify)
      .process(content);

    const contentHtml = processedContent.toString();

    return {
      title: data.title,
      date: data.date,
      content: contentHtml,
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error getting post data:', error);
    return null;
  }
}

export default async function PostPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const postData = await getPostData(params.slug);

  if (!postData) {
    notFound();
  }

  return (
    <main className="px-8 py-16">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">{postData.title}</h1>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">{postData.date.toDateString()}</p>
      <article dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: postData.content }} />
    </main>
  );
}
```

**Key Changes**

*   **`unified()`:**  We now use the `unified()` processor to create a pipeline for processing Markdown.
*   **`remarkParse`:** This plugin parses the Markdown content into an AST.
*   **`remarkRehype`:** This plugin converts the Markdown AST to an HTML AST.
    *   **`allowDangerousHtml: true`:**  This option is crucial for allowing raw HTML within your Markdown.
*   **`rehypeRaw`:** This plugin processes the raw HTML in the AST.
*   **`rehypeStringify`:** This plugin converts the HTML AST back to an HTML string.

**Important Notes**

*   **Install necessary packages:** Make sure you have all the required packages installed:

    ```bash
    npm install unified remark-parse remark-rehype rehype-raw rehype-stringify
    ```

*   **Type definitions:** Ensure you have the correct type definitions for these packages. You might need to install or update `@types/unified`, `@types/remark-parse`, `@types/remark-rehype`, `@types/rehype-raw`, and `@types/rehype-stringify`.

*   **rehypeRaw placement:**  The placement of `rehypeRaw` in the pipeline is important. It should be placed after `remarkRehype` to ensure it processes the raw HTML correctly.

Let me know if this helps resolve the issue or if you encounter any new errors with this approach.
